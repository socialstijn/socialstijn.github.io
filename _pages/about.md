My name is Sijn Brattinga. I'e been working with Macs for about 10 years. The last few years I've been a member of the Macadmins community, a huge source of knowledge and support. This has inspired me to start sharing some of my challenges & experiences.

During office hours you can find me at [Macnify] (https://www.macnify.com), a small MSP operating just outside of Amsterdam, setting up MDM solutions for a group of very fun clients.
